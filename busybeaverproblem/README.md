<b> BUSY BEAVER FUNCTION </B>

The first of which is the busy beaver function, which is the fastest growing function amongst any concievable computable function. So far, it has only been computed for n = 1,2,3,4 and is currently being computed for n =5.

So what is the busy beaver function? This function aims to determine the maximum number of 1's produced by a halting Turing machine, chosen from many concievable machines with n-states, while operating on an infinite tape of 0's. It is termed non-computable, because there is an element of uncertainty in descerning the halting status of a specific turing machine. There is no way of knowing for sure if a machine will halt during the course of its computation, until it halts. Consequently, it is possible for a machine to be in operation for a very long time. 

In this repo, I have tried to compute the first 4 busy beaver numbers.
